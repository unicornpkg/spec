# Indev (unstable)

The first revision of the specification. The only thing that is different from v1.0.0 is that `instdat.filemaps` and `pkgType` has been removed in favor of `instdat.providers`.

**This a draft! Nothing in this version of the specification has been implemented in the reference implementation!**
